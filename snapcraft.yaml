  Pyflow manages Python installations and dependencies.

  **Goals**: Make using and publishing Python projects as simple as possible. Actively
  managing Python environments shouldn't be required to use dependencies safely. We're attempting
  to fix each stumbling block in the Python workflow, so that it's as elegant
  as the language itself.

  You don't need Python or any other tools installed to use Pyflow.

  It runs standalone scripts in their
  own environments with no config, and project functions directly from the CLI.

  It implements [PEP 582 -- Python local packages directory](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/)
  and [Pep 518 (pyproject.toml)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/), and supports Python â‰¥ 3.4.
